On this day we had meeting with Rutvik Joshi and Danish Ansari at 6:00 pm.
In this meeting I first create a virtual machine with ubuntu 20.04 LTS and and install osdag installer from osdag website and successfully ran osdag software. while running the software I encountered different errors and fixed them with my mentors.
Also fork and clone osdag repository to my local computer and configured it with PyCharm editor and set up `miniconda3/bin/python3.7` as a interpreter.

On this day I read all the [documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H3WVOoegyfATZ-HNCgjrJ3VXI1zjh5sd) that related to Osdag software. Tried to understand `Hierarchy of Modules` , How to add new modules, what is `Input Dock` and `Output Dock` in modules.
