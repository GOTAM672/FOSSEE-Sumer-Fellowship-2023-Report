# FOSSEE-Sumer-Fellowship-2023-Report

### Day 1 [17-05-2023]

On this day we had meeting with Rutvik Joshi and Danish Ansari at 6:00 pm.
In this meeting I first create a virtual machine with ubuntu 20.04 LTS and and install osdag installer from osdag website and successfully ran osdag software. while running the software I encountered different errors and fixed them with my mentors.
Also fork and clone osdag repository to my local computer and configured it with PyCharm editor and set up interpreter.
